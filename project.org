** Install
** Initialize project

   Create a basic project:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ eliom-distillery -name reactive_tic_tack_toe -template basic.ppx
   #+END_SRC

*** What the basic project template includes

    ~cd~ into the directory and see what the template has set up for us:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ cd reactive_tic_tack_toe
    $ ls
    Makefile                      README                        reactive_tic_tack_toe.eliom
    Makefile.options              reactive_tic_tack_toe.conf.in static
    #+END_SRC

    You should read the ~README~ for a helpful description of these files. But,
    here's a brief account of the essentials:

    - ~reactive_tic_tack_toe.eliom~ :: The code defining our site goes here.
    - ~static~ :: Static resources will go here, such as images and CSS files.
    - ~Makefile.options~ :: Configuration of the project goes here. We'll get to
         this later.
